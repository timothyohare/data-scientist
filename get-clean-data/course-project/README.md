Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
=========

There is one script called [run_analysis.R]
It reads in all of the data files and combines them in to one data.frame called combo.

Tasks completed:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 

Tasks not yet completed
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


I got stuck trying to replace the actvitiy labels.
