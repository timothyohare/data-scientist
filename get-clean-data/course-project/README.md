Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
=========

There is one script called [run_analysis.R]
It reads in all of the data files and combines them in to one data.frame called combo.

Tasks completed:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

 

Tasks not yet completed
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set



I got stuck trying to replace the actvitiy labels.

The summary of the data is shown in [combined_tidy_dataset_summary.txt]
